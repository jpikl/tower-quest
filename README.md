# Tower Quest: The Unfinished Journey

Tower Quest is a retro-themed puzzle game inspired by the NES classic [Adventures of Lolo][4].

Your goal is to collect all diamonds in every level while moving things and avoiding enemies.

## Status

**This game is not finished ... and it will (probably) never be.**

It was made during 2012 - 2013, but, due to lack of time and other circumstances, its development never reached a state when I would consider it a final product.

Recently, I rediscovered it sitting on my hard drive, and decided to publish it in its current state with some minor bugfixes.

Do not expect a polished experience. There are placeholder assets everywhere, including annoying procedurally pre-generated music. The difficulty of levels is unbalanced sometimes ridiculously high. However, I think some people might still find it an interesting experience.

If anybody is interested, the source code is available on [github][1].

Also, this game was made with [LÖVE ♥][5].

## Downloads

The latest release should be available on [itch.io][3].

## FAQ

#### How do I start the game? There is no executable file.

If you have downloaded the universal release (the one that does not include executable), you will have to install [LÖVE framework][5] (0.11) to run the game. After that, open the `.love` file directly or from command line using `love tower-quest.love`.

#### The game speed is too slow!

Enable *Turbo mode* in game settings.

#### Where can I report bugs?

[Here][2], but I am not promising anything.
